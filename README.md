# DiseasePrediction
This project focuses on predicting disease outbreaks with a particular emphasis on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a case study. We utilized time-series analysis techniques such as ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM, alongside classification methods including decision trees, random forests, and neural networks to forecast and categorize outbreak risks.
Developed predictive models to classify countries into low, moderate, and high-risk categories based on their healthcare infrastructure and socio-economic metrics, using machine learning algorithms. The methodologies are adaptable to other infectious diseases, making this a versatile tool in global health crisis management.
The models were able to effectively predict and classify the risk levels of different countries, assisting in strategic planning for healthcare resource allocation.
